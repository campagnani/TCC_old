title = "Bicycle Dynamics and Control",
abstract = "In this paper, the dynamics of bicycles is analyzed from the perspective of control. Models of different complexity are presented, starting with simple ones and ending with more realistic models generated from multibody software. Models that capture essential behavior such as self-stabilization as well as models that demonstrate difficulties with rear wheel steering are considered. Experiences using bicycles in control education along with suggestions for fun and thought-provoking experiments with proven student attraction are presented. Finally, bicycles and clinical programs designed for children with disabilities are described.",
